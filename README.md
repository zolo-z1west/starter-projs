Mastering basics of any language is really important before diving deep down into creating projects and solving problems. 
I'm gonna save code files and their explanation in another file for you to read and learn.
Dw, you do not need any prior knowledge to learn through my docs ;)

p.s. im learning as im creating this myself
Happy learning!
